## Lab Documentation: Welcome to React, Next.js & TailwindCSS

Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share the progress I've made on our latest lab! In this project, I had the opportunity to create a "Cookie Stand Admin" app using a fantastic combination of React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Let me give you an overview of what I accomplished:

### Overview
The lab started with a clear goal: building a Cookie Stand Admin app. To achieve this, I decided to use React as the foundation, enhanced by the powerful features of Next.js, and styled the app with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS.

### Feature Tasks and Requirements
Here are the key tasks and requirements that I worked on:

1. **Page Setup**: I made sure to set up the main page, `pages/Index.js`, with a `<Head>` component that had the page title set to "Cookie Stand Admin". This little detail ensures that users see the right title in their browser tabs.

2. **Header**: Designing the `<header>` component was exciting! I created a stunning header that matched the specified design. The header sets the tone of the app and welcomes users to our Cookie Stand Admin.

3. **Main Section**: In the `<main>` component, I implemented a `<form>` that allows users to input data for their cookie stands. Additionally, I added a placeholder component to display the JSON string of the last created Cookie Stand.

4. **Footer**: To round off the app, I crafted a `<footer>` component that adhered to the specified design. A good footer always adds a professional touch to any application.

5. **Styling**: Styling the app with Tailwind CSS utility classes was super fun! Tailwind CSS made it easy to apply pre-defined utility classes for rapid styling.

### Implementation Notes
Setting up the project was straightforward, following these steps:

1. I created a new Next.js project named "cookie-stand-admin" using the command `npx create-next-app@latest cookie-stand-admin --javascript --eslint`.

2. To keep the project organized, I removed any unnecessary files generated during the project creation process.

3. To streamline development and access additional utilities, I utilized the Tailwind CSS Extension Pack.

### Completion Criteria
I'm happy to announce that I successfully met all the lab requirements! The "Cookie Stand Admin" app is now fully functional, built with Next.js, and styled to perfection using Tailwind CSS. I believe the header, the form, and the footer all came together nicely to create a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

### Additional Notes
While staying true to the specified requirements, I took the opportunity to add a personal touch and some extra features to make the app even better. Ensuring everything worked seamlessly, I thoroughly tested all components and features.

I'm really proud of the work I've done on this lab, and I hope everyone enjoys exploring the "Cookie Stand Admin" app as much as I enjoyed building it!
